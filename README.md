# Depth Sense
    * Produces a reasonable depth map given a monocular iamge
    * Trained on RedWEbv1


## Methodology
* This project closely follows the practices of Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd series
* The util and pytorch board util scripts were inspired from the Dive into Deep Learning
* notes from the books can be found in notes/ folder

# Experiments
    * Online Mini Sampling to calculate ordinal distances
    * Improved Ranking loss which forces model to learn on hard ordinal pairs to improve generalization

## Perfomance 

## Perfomance on semantic segmentation and Scene Understanding
