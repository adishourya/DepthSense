# Depth Sense
    * Produces a reasonable depth map given a monocular iamge
    * Trained on RedWEbv1


## Methodology
* This project closely follows the practices of Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd series
* The util and pytorch board util scripts were inspired from the Dive into Deep Learning
* notes from the books can be found in notes/ folder
